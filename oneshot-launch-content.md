## Main Launch Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**
```
Introducing oneshotcoding

The platform where everything is built with exactly ONE prompt.

No edits. No iterations. No second chances.

Can you ship in one shot?

```

**Tweet 2 (The Rules)**
```
Here's how it works:

1. Write ONE prompt
2. Get ONE response
3. Ship what you get

That's it.

No "let me fix this real quick"
No "just one more tweak"
No iterations of any kind

What you get is what you ship.
```

**Tweet 3 (The Why)**
```
Why does this matter?

Because anyone can iterate their way to something decent.

One-shot building separates prompt engineers from prompt guessers.

It's the difference between luck and skill.

Time to prove which one you have.
```

**Tweet 4 (Social Proof)**
```
People said it couldn't be done.

Then someone built a working multiplayer game in one prompt.

Someone else shipped a full landing page with animations.

Another person created a Chrome extension that actually works.

All one shot. All on the platform.

[SCREENSHOTS of examples]
